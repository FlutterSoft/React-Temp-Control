# React Temperature Control
A very basic React project that allows you to increase and decrease a temperature control and adjusts colour accordingly.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS

Basic React and CSS.

## Optimizations

It would be cool if it slightly modified colour on every + or - of the temperature. Possibly a function that adds and subtracts from RGB value and passes that value in. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learning about State.
